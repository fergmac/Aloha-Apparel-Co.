This time around I had some real break throughs with flex box, and a better understanding of why mobile first is so important.

I had some trouble with the media queries. I was unable to get them to work correctly in Chrome. Unable to recognize the under 600px settings. However everything looked great in Safari and Opera. 

also i was unable to get my submit button to align correctly in Chrome. Though it was fine in Safari and Opera.

I'm getting a better hang of using dev tools on my own website to try out fixes for problems that appear which is better than bouncing back and forth between sublime and the browser.

Some of the basic javascript principles are starting to sink in and the jQuery is great!


Also I validated my html and css and took care of any errors, but i also had two Warnings "section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements" i left them as is for now not sure how big of a deal that is?
