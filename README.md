Going back over the Aloha project was very interesting, I realized how important it is to organize and comment code. It makes a big difference when try to go back and solve specific issues. 

I was able to read back through the code including the Javascript/Jquery with a better understanding of how everything works. 

I also think that my eye for what looks good on the screen has improved and i'm able to see the finer details of the design comps and bring those to life in my code.
